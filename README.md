# Introduction

**Webpack - NLP Project - Summary**
<br /> This project is configured using webpack to bundle resources for the client app. The server app integrates with the MeaningCloud API for NLP (Sentiment Analysis) queries by URL. The server endpoint takes user input (a valid URL) and delivers to the client app a breakdown of the sentiments found throughout an article or blog (as determined my MeaningCloud's NLP algorithm). This information is then displayed to the user in a chart which breaks down sentiments found in sentences throughout the article/blog.
