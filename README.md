# History
**Week 1**
<br />*__Udacity Starter code__*
<br />. What I learn from this starter code is always use the href attribute to link your files or even projects.The `href`attribute is always convenient, especially for linking all types of files with cool looking effects. If you need to make 10 files 'like me' or more, you'll be able to do as plenty as you want. Always remember to keep your files and folder organized. 

**Week 2**
<br />*__Implementing Navigation Menu, Home Page, and Importing Images__*
<br /> I followed the Udacity video to begin the navigation menu on the landing webpage. At first It was just a basic navigation menu with 4 buttons and 4 images, then I realized that just having 4 buttons and 4 images with nothing interesting to see. So I decided to not only look at Udacity videos for help, but also the resources it offers. I did a lot of research on YouTube and w3schools with information that were relevant. 

**Week 3**
<br /> *__Implementing Smooth Scroll__*
<br />I wanted to expand my project and make it more interesting. With the help from the resources gathered like w3schools, youtube.com, TraversyMedia.com. I began to learn the smooth scroll effect for my `js/main.js`. Smooth Scroll is such a cool effect for a landing webpage, especially for a beginners page. If you change the number for the scroll to a higher number you'll get a faster effect. Same goes for slow effect, just lower the number of the Scroll.

**Week 4**
<br />*__Discovering different methods for improving the landing webpage__*
<br />When I began to discover and learn Javascript Keywords.let, const, booleans, loops, events, functions. Knowledging Attributes like `<a>, <button>,<script>, <style>, <link>, <input>` link href. Swotting in CSS Properties like Margins and Paddings, background-color background-image background-position background-repeatbackground-size, etc. I was able to make different pages and add gifs instead of regular images.I even replace the images that was in the LandPage to gifs.
